  The 21st night of September?
  Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
  While chasin' the clouds away
  Our hearts were ringin'
  In the key that our souls were singin'
  As we danced in the night, remember
  How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah
  Hey, hey, hey
  Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
  Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
  Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
  Ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du
  Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da, ba-du
  Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da 
  My thoughts are with you
  Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
  Only blue talk and love, remember
  How we knew love was here to stay
  Now December
  Found the love that we shared in September
  Only blue talk and love, remember
  The true love we share today
  Hey, hey, hey
  Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
  Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
  Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day There was a Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember? Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days  The bell was ringin', oh, oh Our souls were singin' Do you remember never a cloudy day? Yow There was a Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember? Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September

<p><a href="#">This is a link.</a>"Who’s joe?" a distant voice asks.

  Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.
  
  The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.
  
  ”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.
  
  The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.
  
  "I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth.</p>
